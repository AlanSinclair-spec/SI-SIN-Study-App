  // Chapter 1: The Transition of the Year 2000
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch1",
    text: "The information revolution will be the most sweeping transformation in history, dwarfing the shift from farm to factory that gave rise to the modern world.",
    context: "Introducing the thesis that the information age represents a megapolitical transformation of unprecedented scale.",
  },
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch1",
    text: "Those who understand the transition early will profit enormously. Those who cling to the logic of the industrial age will be among its greatest victims.",
    context: "Warning readers about the asymmetric advantages of anticipating the coming transformation.",
  },

  // Chapter 2: Megapolitical Transformations in Historic Perspective
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch2",
    text: "The logic of violence, not the logic of morality, is the primary determinant of how societies organize. Change the technology of violence, and you change the structure of society.",
    context: "Stating the core analytical framework of megapolitics.",
  },
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch2",
    text: "The history of government is the history of armed men extracting wealth from productive people. The information age is the first era in which this extraction becomes optional.",
    context: "Framing the state as a predatory institution whose power is eroded by information technology.",
  },

  // Chapter 3: East of Eden
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch3",

    context: "Tracing the predatory origins of the state to the agricultural revolution.",
  },
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch3",
    text: "The form in which wealth is held determines who can seize it and therefore who holds political power. When wealth becomes intangible, it becomes unseizable.",
    context: "Explaining why information-age wealth undermines the basis of state power.",
  },

  // Chapter 4: The Last Days of Politics
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch4",
    text: "Democracy was not the culmination of political evolution but a specific adaptation to industrial-age conditions that are now disappearing.",
    context: "Challenging the assumption that democracy is a permanent and universal form of governance.",
  },
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch4",
    text: "The welfare state depended on taxing immobile labor. When the most productive workers can live and work anywhere, the welfare state loses its revenue base and its rationale.",

  },

  // Chapter 5: The Life and Death of the Nation-State
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch5",

    context: "Predicting the obsolescence of the nation-state as information technology transforms the economics of governance.",
  },
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch5",
    text: "Governments will increasingly be obliged to treat their citizens as customers rather than captive subjects, or watch them leave.",
    context: "Describing competitive governance as citizenship becomes a product rather than an identity.",
  },
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch5",
    text: "Taxation is merely extortion by another name. The only difference between a tax collector and a mugger is the tax collector's claim to legitimacy—a claim that technology is eroding.",

  },

  // Chapter 6: The Megapolitics of the Information Age
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch6",
    text: "The miniaturization of technology is the most subversive force in human history. It puts the power to create and destroy in the hands of ever-smaller groups and, ultimately, individuals.",
    context: "Explaining how miniaturization shifts the balance of power from large institutions to individuals.",
  },
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch6",
    text: "In the information age, defense is cheaper than offense, the small can challenge the large, and the smart can outmaneuver the strong. This reverses the fundamental logic of industrial-age power.",
    context: "Describing how information technology reverses industrial-age dynamics of power.",
  },

  // Chapter 7: Transcending Locality
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch7",
    text: "When commerce migrates to cyberspace, governments lose the ability to tax, regulate, and control it. The most important economic activity will occur in a realm where no government has sovereignty.",

  },
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch7",
    text: "Digital money, encrypted and borderless, will be to the information age what coined money was to the commercial age—a revolution in how value is stored and exchanged.",
    context: "Prophetically describing digital currency decades before Bitcoin.",
  },
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch7",
    text: "Jurisdiction shopping will become the primary mechanism through which individuals discipline governments. A government that taxes too heavily will simply lose its most productive citizens.",
    context: "Predicting that competition among jurisdictions will constrain state power.",
  },

  // Chapter 8: The End of Egalitarian Economics
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch8",
    text: "The relatively egalitarian income distribution of the industrial age was not a moral achievement but a side effect of the need for interchangeable factory labor. The information age has no such need.",

  },
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch8",
    text: "In the information economy, a single talented individual can produce more value than a thousand average workers. The returns to cognitive skill will be unlike anything in human history.",

  // Chapter 9: Nationalism, Reaction, and the New Luddites
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch9",
    text: "Every megapolitical transition provokes a furious backlash from those who lose status, income, and power. The coming transition will be no exception—expect nationalism, xenophobia, and violence.",
    context: "Predicting the reactionary backlash that would accompany the information-age transition.",
  },
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch9",
    text: "The new Luddites will not smash looms. They will demand regulations, trade barriers, and capital controls to prevent the information revolution from destroying their way of life.",
    context: "Describing modern forms of resistance to technological transformation.",
  },

  // Chapter 10: The Twilight of Democracy
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch10",

  },
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch10",
    text: "The information age will replace government by majority rule with governance by market signals—the movement of people and capital to the jurisdictions that serve them best.",
    context: "Envisioning post-democratic governance driven by competition rather than elections.",
  },

  // Chapter 11: Morality and Crime in the Natural Economy

  },
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch11",
    text: "When the state can no longer redistribute wealth, rewards will more closely track contribution. This natural economy will be more efficient and more brutal than anything we have known.",
    context: "Characterizing the 'natural economy' that emerges when coercive redistribution becomes impractical.",
  },
  {
    chapterRef: "si_ch11",
    text: "In the information age, reputation will replace regulation. Trust will be built through cryptographic verification and track records, not through the coercive authority of the state.",
