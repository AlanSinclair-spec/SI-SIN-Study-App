    title: "The Transition of the Year 2000",
    slug: "transition-year-2000",
    summary:
      "Davidson and Rees-Mogg introduce the concept of megapolitical transitions--rare, sweeping shifts in the way power is organized that reshape civilization itself. They argue that the dawn of the information age represents the fourth great stage of human economic life, following hunter-gatherer, agricultural, and industrial societies. The microprocessing revolution, they contend, will undermine the power of nation-states by making it possible for individuals to conduct commerce and protect assets beyond the reach of governments. The chapter sets the tone for the entire book: the coming transformation will be as disorienting as the shift from feudalism to industrialism, and those who understand it first will benefit enormously.",

    title: "Megapolitical Transformations in Historic Perspective",
    slug: "megapolitical-transformations-historic",
    summary:
      "This chapter establishes the analytical framework the authors use throughout the book: megapolitics, or the study of how changes in the technology of violence alter the boundaries of political organization. Davidson and Rees-Mogg survey the major transitions in history--from foraging bands to agricultural kingdoms to industrial nation-states--showing that each was driven by shifts in who could project force and at what cost. They argue that the logic of violence, not ideology or culture, is the primary determinant of how societies organize. Understanding this pattern is essential for anticipating what the information age will bring.",

    title: "East of Eden",
    slug: "east-of-eden",
    summary:
      "The authors examine the agricultural revolution as a case study in megapolitical transformation, exploring how the shift from nomadic foraging to settled farming created the conditions for organized violence and systematic taxation. Surplus food production made it possible for specialists in coercion--warriors and kings--to extract wealth from producers, giving rise to the first states. They draw parallels between this ancient transition and the coming information-age shift, noting that each era's dominant form of wealth determines who can seize it and how. The chapter underscores that taxation and government have always been parasitic on the prevailing mode of production, and that a new mode will necessarily create new political forms.",

    title: "The Last Days of Politics",
    slug: "last-days-of-politics",
    summary:
      "Davidson and Rees-Mogg argue that mass democracy, far from being a permanent feature of civilization, is a product of industrial-age megapolitics that is now approaching obsolescence. The factory system required large, concentrated workforces that could be mobilized politically, making universal suffrage a logical concession by elites. As information technology disperses economic activity, the bargaining power of the masses declines, and the welfare state loses its economic rationale. The authors predict that politics will become less relevant as productive individuals exit the system and governments can no longer compel compliance through sheer force.",

    title: "The Life and Death of the Nation-State",
    slug: "life-death-nation-state",
    summary:
      "The nation-state is analyzed as an institution whose power derives from its ability to monopolize violence over a defined territory and extract taxes from residents who have limited exit options. The authors compare governments to stationary bandits who provide a measure of order in exchange for extortionate tribute. As information technology makes it possible to move wealth across borders at the speed of light, the nation-state's taxing power erodes and governance becomes competitive rather than monopolistic. Citizenship itself becomes a product that jurisdictions must sell by offering attractive terms. The chapter envisions a future where hundreds of micro-sovereignties compete for the allegiance of mobile, wealthy individuals.",

    title: "The Megapolitics of the Information Age",
    slug: "megapolitics-information-age",
    summary:
      "This chapter explores how information technology fundamentally alters the logic of violence that has governed political organization throughout history. The miniaturization of technology means that the capacity for both production and destruction can be wielded by ever-smaller groups and even individuals, eroding the state's advantage in scale. Asymmetric warfare becomes more prevalent as cheap, intelligent weapons neutralize the mass armies on which nation-states depend. The authors argue that the information age favors defense over offense, the small over the large, and the smart over the strong--a reversal of industrial-age dynamics with profound consequences for who holds power.",

    title: "Transcending Locality",
    slug: "transcending-locality",
    summary:
      "Davidson and Rees-Mogg envision a world in which commerce migrates into cyberspace, severing the historic link between economic activity and physical territory. They predict the rise of digital money--encrypted, anonymous, and untraceable--which will make it practically impossible for governments to monitor or tax transactions. Jurisdiction shopping becomes the norm as individuals and businesses choose their legal domicile based on the best combination of services and costs. The chapter describes how transcending locality will dissolve the geographic basis of political power and create a truly global, borderless economy. Governments that fail to adapt will see their tax bases evaporate as the most productive citizens relocate to friendlier jurisdictions.",

    title: "The End of Egalitarian Economics",
    slug: "end-egalitarian-economics",
    summary:
      "The authors argue that the industrial age's relatively egalitarian income distribution was an anomaly driven by the need for large numbers of interchangeable factory workers. In the information age, returns to cognitive skill rise dramatically while demand for unskilled labor collapses, producing a winner-take-all economy dominated by a cognitive elite. Redistribution becomes both technically harder--because wealth is mobile--and politically less feasible as the top earners gain exit options. The chapter warns that the egalitarian assumptions embedded in Western democracies will be shattered, creating deep social tension between a small class of sovereign individuals and a much larger group left behind by the transition.",

    slug: "nationalism-reaction-new-luddites",
    summary:
      "This chapter examines the inevitable backlash that megapolitical transitions provoke from those whose status and livelihood depend on the existing order. The authors predict a surge of reactionary nationalism, xenophobia, and neo-Luddism as industrial-age institutions lose their grip and large populations face downward mobility. They draw historical parallels to the violent resistance that accompanied the decline of feudalism and the rise of industrialism. The transition period is identified as the most dangerous phase, when desperate governments and displaced populations may resort to destructive measures including confiscation, capital controls, and scapegoating of successful minorities.",

    title: "The Twilight of Democracy",
    slug: "twilight-of-democracy",
    summary:
      "Davidson and Rees-Mogg subject democracy to a skeptical megapolitical analysis, arguing that it is not a universal good but a specific institutional arrangement suited to industrial-age conditions. Majority rule systematically produces short-term thinking, fiscal irresponsibility, and redistribution that punishes the most productive. Information asymmetries allow political insiders to exploit the rationally ignorant majority, while the growing complexity of governance makes meaningful democratic oversight impossible. The authors contend that as the information age matures, the democratic nation-state will be outcompeted by leaner, more accountable forms of governance that treat citizens as customers rather than subjects.",

    slug: "morality-crime-natural-economy",
    summary:
      "The final chapter considers the ethical and social dimensions of the sovereign individual's world. The authors argue that the information age will create a 'natural economy' in which rewards track contribution more closely because coercive redistribution becomes impractical. Crime will change character: physical robbery declines as wealth becomes intangible, but cybercrime and fraud rise as the primary threats. Moral hazard shifts as individuals bear more direct consequences for their choices without the safety net of the welfare state. The chapter concludes with a vision of personal sovereignty in which individuals take full responsibility for their own security, education, and retirement--a world of radical freedom accompanied by radical accountability.",
